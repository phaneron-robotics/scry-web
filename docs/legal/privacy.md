# Scry — Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 17 May 2026
**Last updated:** 23 May 2026

This privacy policy explains what data Scry handles, where that data
goes, and the controls you have over it. Scry is published by
**Phaneron Robotics, Inc.** ("we", "us"). The app is distributed
through the Google Play Store under the package id
`com.phaneronrobotics.scry`.

If you have questions or want your data deleted, email
**privacy@phaneronrobotics.com**.

## 1. What Scry is

Scry is a mobile client for debugging ROS 2 robots. It connects to a
[scry-connect](https://github.com/phaneron-robotics/scry-connect)
server running on your robot or development host and provides a
chat-style interface where an AI assistant can read the robot's
state and (with your explicit approval) call write tools on it.

We do not operate any cloud backend. Scry runs entirely on your
phone, communicates directly with **your** robot's scry-connect
server, and (if you opt into a cloud AI provider) forwards your chat
messages directly from the phone to **that provider's** API.

---

## 2. Data Scry stores on your device

All of the following live in app-private storage. Other apps cannot
read them and they are excluded from the system backup.

| Category | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Robot connection profiles** | host, port, optional pairing token, mDNS name | Encrypted SQLite (Android Room) |
| **Chat history** | your messages, the AI's responses, tool calls and their results | Encrypted SQLite |
| **API keys** | the credentials you paste in for Claude / OpenAI / Gemini | Android EncryptedSharedPreferences (AES-256-GCM, master key in Android Keystore) |
| **App preferences** | provider/model choice, Ollama URL, UI toggles | EncryptedSharedPreferences |
| **Cached attachments** | screenshots and gallery imports you attach to chat messages | App cache directory; cleared by the system on low-storage pressure |

You can wipe everything by **Settings → Clear all data** in Android's
app settings (this is the standard Android control; we don't add a
custom wipe button because the system one is more reliable).

---

## 3. Data Scry sends off your device

Scry forwards data to **two kinds** of external services. Both are
under your direct control.

### 3.1 Your robot's scry-connect server

When you pair Scry to a robot, every read/write tool call and every
SSE topic subscription goes to that robot's IP over plain HTTP on
your LAN (or HTTPS if you've configured a TLS terminator in front of
scry-connect). The traffic stays inside your own network unless you
expose scry-connect's port to the internet — which we do not
recommend.

**What we send:** the tool name, its arguments, and the chat context
needed to render the response. **What we receive:** the tool result.

We don't telemeter any of this back to us. We have no servers.

### 3.2 The AI provider you chose

Scry supports four AI providers. The chat-message bytes (your text,
the assistant's reply, any image attachments you sent, and the tool
results returned by the robot) are sent to **whichever provider you
pick in the chat top-bar chip**:

| Provider | Endpoint | Privacy policy |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Claude | `api.anthropic.com` | https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy |
| OpenAI | `api.openai.com` | https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy |
| Google Gemini | `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | https://policies.google.com/privacy |
| Ollama (local) | the URL you entered in Settings (defaults to your robot's host on port 11434) | not applicable — Ollama runs on your machine and does not send data over the internet |

When using a cloud provider, your chat content is subject to that
provider's privacy policy and data-handling terms — including any
retention they apply for abuse / safety review and any model-training
policies. We pass your API key in the `Authorization` header on each
request; we never see the request or response content because there
is no Scry backend.

**Ollama is the only AI provider option that keeps all chat data on
your local network.** It is the default suggested in onboarding for
exactly this reason.

### 3.3 Account (required to use Scry)

Scry requires an account. There are four ways to create one:

| Method | What we receive |
|---|---|
| **Continue with Google** | Email + name from your Google account, plus a Google-issued user ID. We never see your Google password. |
| **Continue with GitHub** | Email + name from your GitHub account, plus a GitHub-issued user ID. We never see your GitHub password. |
| **Email magic link** | Email only. You finish sign-in by tapping a link we email you. |
| **Email + password** | Email + a password you choose. The password is sent over TLS, hashed (bcrypt) by Supabase, and never stored in plain text — we as the operator cannot read it. |

After auth completes, the **profile screen** asks for two more things:

| Field | Required |
|---|---|
| Your name (pre-filled from Google/GitHub if available) | Optional — you can edit or clear it |
| Company / lab | Optional |
| Role (Roboticist / ML engineer / Student / Hobbyist / Other) | Optional |

**Why we require an account:**

- To sync chat history and robot pairings across your devices.
- To restore your work if you reinstall.
- So we can tell you about meaningful product updates (rarely — not a
  newsletter).

**Where it lives:** a Supabase project we run in the US-West
(`us-west-2`, Oregon) region. Two tables are involved:

- `auth.users` — managed by Supabase. Holds your email, hashed password
  (only if you signed up with email/password), and the OAuth provider
  identity if you signed in with Google/GitHub.
- `public.profiles` — joined 1:1 to `auth.users` by user ID. Holds
  the role/company you typed on the profile screen plus app version,
  Android SDK level, and locale.

Encryption: TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest, password hashes via
bcrypt (Supabase Auth default). **Row-level security** ensures the app
key shipped in the apk can only read or modify **your** profile row —
not any other user's.

**Supabase is the data processor**; Phaneron Robotics is the data
controller. The Supabase DPA covers their handling obligations under
GDPR Art. 28.

**What we never send to our backend:** chat content, robot data
(topics, nodes, services, parameters), your API keys for Anthropic /
OpenAI / Google, screenshots, voice transcripts. None of that touches
our database. See §3.1 and §3.2 for where it goes instead.

**After the first connect:** when you successfully pair your first
robot, we patch your profile row with a `first_connect_meta` JSON
blob containing the robot's ROS distribution, RMW implementation, and
the number of nodes/topics it advertises. We never include the
robot's hostname, IP, or any topic contents.

**Deletion:** email **privacy@phaneronrobotics.com** asking us to
delete your account. We honour deletion requests within 30 days;
usually within 24 hours. The deletion is a SQL `DELETE` on the
`auth.users` row, which cascades to your `profiles` row. Your session
JWT becomes invalid on next API call; the app pushes you back to the
sign-in screen.

**Lawful basis:** Contract (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b)) — the account is
necessary to provide the service. You can terminate the contract at
any time by requesting deletion.

**Signing out:** Settings → Sign out clears your session locally
without deleting your account. Your row stays in our database so you
can sign back in later on this or any other device.

## 4. Permissions

Scry requests the following Android permissions. Each is requested at
the point you first use the feature, not at install time.

| Permission | What it's for |
|---|---|
| `INTERNET` + `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` + `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` | Talking to scry-connect on your LAN and to AI providers (when you select a cloud provider). |
| `CAMERA` | Optional: take a photo to attach to a chat message ("look at this LED — what's it indicating?"), and scan the pairing QR shown by scry-connect. |
| `RECORD_AUDIO` | Optional: voice-to-text input in chat. Routed to Android's on-device `SpeechRecognizer` — we don't read or store the audio. |
| `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` | Optional: pick an image from your gallery to attach to a chat message. We only read the image you explicitly select. |

We do not request location, contacts, microphone always-on, foreground
service permissions, advertising id, or any other ambient-collection
permission. The full permission list is auditable in
[`app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`](
https://github.com/phaneron-robotics/scry-android/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml).

---

## 5. Analytics, crash reporting, advertising

**None of the above.** Scry ships with no analytics SDK, no crash
reporter, no advertising id integration, and no third-party tracker.
You can confirm this by inspecting the dependency list in
[`app/build.gradle.kts`](
https://github.com/phaneron-robotics/scry-android/blob/master/app/build.gradle.kts) —
there is no Firebase, Crashlytics, Sentry, Google Analytics, AppsFlyer,
Adjust, Mixpanel, or similar.

If a future version adds crash reporting we will (a) make it opt-in,
(b) document it in this policy, and (c) bump the "Last updated" date
at the top.

---

## 6. Children

Scry is built for adult developers working on robotics projects. It
is not directed at children under 13 (or under 16 in jurisdictions
covered by GDPR-K), and we do not knowingly collect data from
children.

---

## 7. Data subject rights (GDPR / CCPA / DPDPA / similar)

You have three layers of control depending on which data you mean:

1. **On-device data** (chat history, robot profiles, API keys,
   attachments): wipe via Android **Settings → Apps → Scry → Clear
   data**. We can't see this data and don't need to act on a request.
2. **Profile capture data** (§3.3 — the row in our Supabase database):
   email **privacy@phaneronrobotics.com** to exercise access,
   correction, deletion, portability, or to withdraw consent. We honour
   requests within 30 days. Identity verification is via reply from the
   email address on the row.
3. **Chat data sent to your chosen AI provider** (§3.2): we never see
   this and can't act on it. Exercise rights directly against
   Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google per their privacy policies.

We do not sell, share for cross-context behavioural advertising, or
otherwise monetise the data described in §3.3. There is no such
disclosure to opt out of.

---

## 8. Security

- API keys are encrypted at rest with Android EncryptedSharedPreferences
  (AES-256-GCM, master key in the Android Keystore).
- Chat history, robot profiles, and attachments live in app-private
  storage (`getFilesDir()` / `getCacheDir()`) — not readable by other
  apps under Android's sandbox.
- All requests to AI providers go over TLS (`network_security_config.xml`
  enforces this).
- We allow plain HTTP for LAN traffic to scry-connect, because most
  ROS 2 deployments don't have a TLS terminator on the robot. If you
  expose scry-connect outside the LAN, put a TLS proxy in front.

---

## 9. Changes to this policy

When we change this policy, we update the date at the top and post a
changelog entry in the GitHub repository under `docs/PRIVACY.md`. We
will not retroactively widen data-collection scope on data we
collected before the change.
