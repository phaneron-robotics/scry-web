# Background monitors

Set a condition like "alert me if `/odom` drops below 10 Hz" — Scry
watches in the background and fires an alert into chat the moment the
condition trips.

## How to set one

Just ask the agent:

```
Watch /odom and alert me if its rate drops below 10 Hz.
```

The agent calls the `monitor_threshold` phone-side meta-tool with the
right parameters. You'll see a confirmation in chat ("Monitor armed:
/odom rate < 10 Hz"). The monitor is now live.

You can also set monitors on:

- **Topic message field values** — "alert me if `/battery_state.percentage`
  drops below 20"
- **Topic publish rates** — as above
- **Service availability** — "alert me if `/global_costmap/clear_entirely_global_costmap`
  becomes unavailable"
- **Node liveness** — "alert me if `/navigation_lifecycle_manager` dies"

## Edge-triggered, not level-triggered

Monitors fire **once per false-to-true transition**, not continuously.
If your battery drops to 19% the monitor fires; it does **not** keep
firing every second while battery stays at 19%. Re-fires when battery
goes above the threshold and then back below.

This matches what you actually want: notifications when something
changed, not a stream of "still bad."

## Where alerts show up

When a monitor trips, an **assistant message** appears in chat:

> ⚠ Monitor fired: `/odom rate < 10 Hz` — current value 7.4 Hz
>
> [robot context excerpt]

It looks identical to a regular assistant reply (same alignment, same
brand mark). Difference is the ⚠ glyph and the explicit "Monitor
fired" prefix.

The agent then sees this message on the next turn, so you can ask
follow-ups like "what's causing the rate drop?" and it'll have full
context.

## Where monitors run

Monitors are **app-scoped**, not robot-scoped:

- `MonitorRegistry` is a Hilt `@Singleton` with `SupervisorJob + Dispatchers.Default`
- Each monitor opens an SSE subscription to the connect's `/stream?topic=…`
- The phone evaluates the predicate on each delta
- Process death cancels all monitors — they don't survive an app restart

That last point matters: monitors are good for "I'm using the app right
now and don't want to miss this." They're **not** a substitute for a
proper alerting system on the robot.

## Listing and stopping monitors

In chat:

```
list my active monitors
```

The agent calls `monitor_list` which returns active monitors with their
IDs, conditions, and current values. The reply renders as a chip strip
above the composer with a **Stop** button on each chip.

You can also tell the agent:

```
stop the /odom monitor
```

And it'll call `cancel_monitor` for you.

## Notifications when the app is backgrounded

Monitors keep running even when Scry is in the background or your
screen is off. When one trips, you get:

1. A standard Android **notification** (requires the Notifications
   permission)
2. The chat message appears in app on next foreground

The notification is just "Monitor fired on [robot name]" — tap it to
open Scry directly to the chat where the alert landed.
